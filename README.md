QoL enhancements: analog controls for Armored Core PS2 series (AC2, AC2 Another Age, AC3, AC Silent Line).

Analog input processing inside these games was retro-fitted using algorithms from AC Nine Breaker.

There is an additional file (WIP) for AC Nine Breaker that allows firing the Inside part/weapon on Type B (classic, non-analog) controls without having to switch to it. It uses "right analog UP" to fire (analogs are not otherwise used with Type B controls, and no other buttons are free). Basically it levels the field with 'Type A' - analog-based - control scheme, who *DOES* have a dedicated button for firing the Inside part/weapon.
